## Control Statements

In C#, control flow statements allow your code to execute different branches based on conditions being met or not. `If`, `else-if`, and `switch` are three types of control statements that are commonly used.

#### if

The `if` statement represents the most fundamental type of control flow statement. It evaluates a condition, and if that condition returns `true`, it executes a corresponding code block.

```csharp
int number = 10;
if (number > 0) 
{
    Console.WriteLine("The number is positive.");
}

// The `if` statement checks whether the number is greater than 0. As this condition is `true`, it prints the output.
```


#### else

The `else` statement is used alongside the `if` statement. It allows you to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition in the `if` statement is `false`.

```csharp
int number = -10;
if (number > 0) {
    Console.WriteLine("The number is positive.");
}
else {
    Console.WriteLine("The number is not positive.");
}

// In this case, since the number is not greater than 0, the condition in the `if` statement is `false`, so the code inside the `else` block is executed, printing "The number is not positive."
```


#### else if

The `else if` statement presents an opportunity to specify new conditions for testing if the initial `if` statement's condition evaluates to `false`.

```csharp
int number = 0;
if (number > 0) {
    Console.WriteLine("The number is positive."); // If the number is greater than 0, it prints "The number is positive.
}
else if (number < 0) {
    Console.WriteLine("The number is negative."); //  If the number is less than 0, it prints "The number is negative.
}
else {
    Console.WriteLine("The number is zero."); // If neither condition is `true`, it prints "The number is zero."
}
```



#### switch

The `switch` statement is a type of selection statement that chooses a single switch section to execute from a list of candidates based on a pattern match with the match expression.

```csharp
int number = 1;
switch (number) {
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("One");
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("Two");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("None");
        break;
}
```

In this case, the `switch` statement evaluates the `number`. It matches the `number` with the cases, and if it finds a match, it executes the code in that case block. In the example above, it would print "One."

The `break` statement serves to terminate the `switch` statement. The absence of the `break` can result in a fall-through to subsequent cases, potentially causing undesired outcomes.

The `default` case within a `switch` statement defines the block of code to be executed should no other cases match the `number`. In the example, if the number was neither 1 nor 2, "None" would be printed.

*These conditional statements constitute powerful instruments enabling programmers to control the flow of execution based on varying conditions. Gaining a comprehensive understanding and effectively employing these tools can yield more efficient and adaptable C# programs.*

## Loops

In C#, looping constructs are used to execute a block of code multiple times, which is necessary for many programming tasks. The major looping constructs in C# include `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

#### for

The `for` loop is a control flow statement facilitating repeated execution of code. It is typically characterised by three components: an initialiser (where you establish your counter variable), a condition (which prompts continuation of the loop if `true` and termination if `false`), and an iterator (which typically increments the counter variable).

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

In this example, the numbers from 0 to 4 are printed. The loop initiates with `i` equal to 0 and proceeds if `i` is less than 5. Following each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

#### while

The `while` loop is another control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given condition. The loop can be thought of as a repeating `if` statement.

```csharp
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++;
}
```

This `while` loop will do the same thing as the `for` loop in the previous example. It will print the numbers 0 to 4. The loop begins by checking if `i` is less than 5. If the condition is `true`, it executes the code within the loop and increments `i` by 1. It will continue to check this condition before each iteration.

#### do-while

The `do-while` loop closely resembles the `while` loop, with one notable difference: the `do-while` loop evaluates its condition at the end of the loop. This implies that the loop's code block is executed at least once, irrespective of the condition.

```csharp
int i = 0;
do {
    Console.WriteLine(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

Similarly to the previous two examples, this `do-while` loop prints the numbers 0 to 4. The loop executes the code block before evaluating the condition. If the condition is `true`, the loop proceeds; if `false`, the loop terminates.

*Understanding these looping constructs is essential to efficient programming in C#, as they present versatile ways to control the flow of your program.*

## Break, continue and goto

In C#, `break`, `continue`, and `goto` statements enable you to control your program's execution flow. They are particularly valuable within loop constructs and switch statements.

#### break

The `break` statement terminates the enclosing loop or switch statement and transfers the execution to the statement immediately succeeding the loop or switch.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 5)
    {
        break;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

In this scenario, the loop prints the numbers from 0 to 4. Once `i` equals 5, the `break` statement is executed, causing an immediate termination of the loop, irrespective of the loop condition.

#### continue

The `continue` statement is used in a loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and immediately start the next iteration.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    if (i == 5)
    {
        continue;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

This loop will print the numbers from 0 to 9 but skip 5. When `i` equals 5, the `continue` statement is executed, the current iteration is terminated, and the next iteration begins.

#### goto

The `goto` statement transfers the program control directly to a labelled statement. A common use of `goto` is to transfer control from a nested loop to an outer loop or to exit deeply nested loops.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
    {
        if (i == 1 && j == 1)
        {
            goto outer;
        }
        Console.WriteLine($"i:{i}, j:{j}");
    }
    outer: Console.WriteLine("Exited from the inner loop");
}
```

In this example, the `goto` statement is executed when `i` equals 1 and `j` equals 1, which causes control to jump immediately to the labelled statement `outer`, effectively breaking out of the inner loop.

*`Please note` - overuse of the `goto` statement can make your code harder to read and understand, and it is generally discouraged in modern programming. Try to use it sparingly, and consider using alternative statements, such as `break` or `continue`.*

## Practice

Q: Paste the output of the first ten numbers generated by the code in the attached file. 
A: 01234567891

What is the output of the following `for` loop?

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
    Console.Write(i);
}
```

Q: Fix, and then paste output of the code in the attached file
A: abcdefghijklm

```csharp
for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++)
{
    if (c == '\u006E')
    {
        // stop the loop
    }
    Console.Write(c);
}
```

Thêm `break` là được -> dừng lại ở ký tự `0x06E=n`.
