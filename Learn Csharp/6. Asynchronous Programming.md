# 1. Asynchronous Programming

`Asynchronous programming` is a powerful technique in modern software development that allows programs to `perform non-blocking operations` and efficiently utilise system resources. It enables applications to `handle time-consuming tasks without blocking the main execution thread`, improving responsiveness and scalability.

In traditional `synchronous programming`, when a method is invoked, the `program waits until the method completes` its execution before proceeding to the following line of code. This blocking behaviour can lead to poor performance and unresponsive applications, especially when dealing with I/O-bound or long-running operations. You can see this behaviour in applications when they appear to `freeze randomly` and `become unresponsive` when you try to load a large file, for instance. `Asynchronous programming` addresses this issue by `allowing tasks to execute independently` without blocking the main thread, enabling other `work to be done concurrently`.

To understand this concept better, it's important to distinguish between `concurrent` and `parallel` operations. `Concurrent` operations refer to tasks that `appear to occur simultaneously` but may not necessarily do so. On the other hand, `parallel` operations involve tasks that are `executed at the same time` on different cores or processors. Asynchronous programming primarily deals with `concurrent operations`, enabling multiple tasks to `progress independently of each other`.

Asynchronous methods return a `Task` or `Task<T>` object representing an ongoing operation. The calling code can continue its execution while the asynchronous operation progresses in the background. Once the operation completes, the result can be retrieved or further processed.

There are a few very important things to be aware of when utilising asynchronous programming:

- `Avoid Blocking Calls`: Use asynchronous versions of methods whenever possible to prevent blocking the main thread.
- `Configure async Methods Properly`: Ensure that `async` methods return `Task` or `Task<T>` and use the `await` keyword appropriately to await the completion of asynchronous operations.
- `Handle Exceptions`: Handle exceptions properly in asynchronous code. Use `try-catch` blocks to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during asynchronous operations. Unhandled exceptions can lead to unexpected application behaviour.
- `Use Cancellation Tokens`: Utilize cancellation tokens to allow the cancellation of asynchronous operations gracefully. This can improve the responsiveness and user experience of the application.

### async & await

In C#, asynchronous programming is facilitated by the `async` and `await` keywords.

The `async` keyword is used to specify that a method, lambda expression, or anonymous method is asynchronous. These methods usually return a `Task` or `Task<T>` object, representing ongoing work.

On the other hand, the `await` keyword is used in an `async` method to suspend the execution of the method until a particular task completes; the program is `awaiting Task<T>` completion. `await` can only be used in an `async` method.

The basic structure of an asynchronous method using `async` and `await` would look like this:



```csharp
async Task<T> MethodName()
{
    //...Method body
    await SomeTask;
    //...Continue after SomeTask finishes
}
```

- `async`: This keyword is used to specify that a method is asynchronous.
- `Task<T>`: An asynchronous method should return a `Task` or `Task<T>`. A `Task` represents an ongoing job that might not have been completed when your method returns. The job is executed concurrently with the rest of your program.
- `MethodName`: This is where you put the name of your method.
- Inside the method body, you use the `await` keyword before a task to specify that the method can't continue until the awaited task completes—meanwhile, control returns to the caller of the method.



```csharp
public async Task<int> CalculateSumAsync(int a, int b)
{
    await Task.Delay(500); //Simulate some delay
    return a + b;
}

public async void CallCalculateSumAsync()
{
    int result = await CalculateSumAsync(5, 6);
    Console.WriteLine($"The sum is {result}");
}
```

In this example, the method `CalculateSumAsync` is marked with the `async` keyword and returns a `Task<int>`. Inside the method, we simulate a delay with `Task.Delay`, which we `await`. This means that while we're waiting for the delay to finish, control can be given back to the caller of this method. After the delay is finished, we calculate the sum and return it. In `CallCalculateSumAsync`, we call our asynchronous method and immediately `await` its result. Once we have the result, we print it to the console.

Let's consider an example where we call a web service to fetch data. Fetching data from a web service can be time-consuming, so we will use `async` and `await` to ensure our application remains responsive during this operation.



```csharp
using System.Net.Http; // Network I/O is explained in more detail on the related page
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static readonly HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    static async Task Main()
    {
        string responseBody = await GetWebsiteContentAsync("http://example.com");

        Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
    }

    static async Task<string> GetWebsiteContentAsync(string url)
    {
        HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(url);
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

        return responseBody;
    }
}
```

The `GetWebsiteContentAsync` method is responsible for fetching the content of a website. It uses an `HttpClient` to send an asynchronous GET request to the provided URL. The `await` keyword waits for the task to complete without blocking the rest of the code.

The `client.GetAsync` method returns a `Task<HttpResponseMessage>` representing the ongoing fetch operation. This task is awaited using the `await` keyword. After ensuring that the HTTP response status indicates success by calling the `EnsureSuccessStatusCode()` method, we read the content of the HTTP response message asynchronously using `response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync()`. This method returns a `Task<string>,` which is also awaited.

Finally, in our `Main` method, we call `GetWebsiteContentAsync` and await its result before writing it to the console.

### Tasks

A Task can be in one of three states: `created`, `running`, or `completed`. Once a Task is completed, it can either result in a value, an exception, or nothing at all.

There are two types of tasks: `Task` and `Task<T>`.

- A `Task` represents a single operation that does not return a value and usually executes asynchronously. After the operation is completed, the Task is marked as completed. This is essentially a `void` async method.
    
- `Task<T>` represents an asynchronous operation that returns a value. The value type (denoted by `T`) is known and can be retrieved once the Task has finished execution.
    

Creating tasks can be done using the `Task.Run` method or implement methods marked with the `async` keyword that return a `Task` or `Task<T>`. Here's an example of creating and running a task:



```csharp
Task<int> task = Task.Run(() => {
    // Simulate work.
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
    return 69;
});
```

In this example, we create a task that sleeps for one second to simulate work and then returns the integer 69.

### Task Cancellation

If necessary, tasks can also be cancelled through the use of cancellation tokens.



```csharp
CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
Task<int> task = Task.Run(() => {
    // Simulate work.
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
    cts.Token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
    return 42;
}, cts.Token);

// Cancel the task.
cts.Cancel();
```

`CancellationToken` is a struct that can be checked periodically by an operation, and if cancellation is requested, the operation can stop itself in a controlled manner.

Cancellation is signalled via the `CancellationTokenSource`. When you want to cancel one or more operations, you call `Cancel` on the `CancellationTokenSource`, which sends a signal to all linked `CancellationToken` instances.



```csharp
public async Task PerformOperationAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    {
        // Simulate some work.
        await Task.Delay(100);

        // Check for cancellation.
        cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
    }
}

public async Task MainAsync()
{
    var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

    var task = PerformOperationAsync(cts.Token);

    // After 500 ms, cancel the operation.
    await Task.Delay(500);
    cts.Cancel();

    try
    {
        await task;
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Operation was cancelled.");
    }
}
```

In this example, we pass a `CancellationToken` to the `PerformOperationAsync` method. Inside the method, after each unit of work (simulated with `Task.Delay`), we check if cancellation has been requested using `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()`. This method throws an `OperationCanceledException` if a cancellation has been requested.

In the `MainAsync` method, we start the operation and cancel it after 500 ms by calling `cts.Cancel()`. This sends a signal to the associated cancellation token. When we await the task, it throws an `OperationCanceledException`, which we catch and handle.

### Exception Handling with Async Code

Exception handling is a critical part of asynchronous programming. When you're dealing with asynchronous operations, there's always a possibility that something might go wrong. The operation could fail, the network could go down, data could be corrupted - the list goes on. Without proper exception handling, these errors could cause your application to crash or behave unpredictably.

Exceptions are propagated when you use `await` on the task. If the task has thrown any exceptions, `await` will re-throw that exception.



```csharp
try
{
    string result = await GetWebsiteContentAsync();
}
catch (HttpRequestException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
```

In this example, we make a web request using the fictitious `FetchDataFromWebAsync` method. If the request fails and throws an `HttpRequestException`, our `catch` block will handle it and write an error message to the console.

If you're dealing with multiple `Tasks` and want to handle exceptions for each Task independently, you can use `Task.ContinueWith`. This method creates a continuation that executes when the task completes, regardless of the state of the antecedent task.



```csharp
var task = FetchDataFromWebAsync();
task.ContinueWith(t =>
{
    if (t.IsFaulted)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {t.Exception.InnerException.Message}");
    }
});
```

In this example, `ContinueWith` is used to specify an action that will happen when the task completes. If the task is faulted (an unhandled exception was thrown), it writes an error message to the console.
# 2. File I/O

---

File Input/Output (I/O) is a critical aspect of many applications and is well supported in C# through the `System.IO` namespace. This namespace provides numerous classes that enable reading from and writing to files, creating new files and directories, and performing operations such as moving, copying, or deleting files.

## FileStream

The `FileStream` class, part of the `System.IO` namespace, provides a powerful and flexible interface for reading from and writing to files. As a core component of C#'s I/O library, `FileStream` supports both sequential and random file access, allowing you to interact with a file's content anywhere, not just at its beginning or end.

A `FileStream` object can be seen as a cursor into the contents of a file, much like a text cursor that you move when editing a document. You can place this cursor at any position within the file and perform read or write operations.

#### Creating a FileStream

There are several ways to create a `FileStream`. One common approach is using its constructor directly, as shown in the following code snippet:



```csharp
FileStream fs = new FileStream("test.dat", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite);
```

In this example, the `FileStream` constructor takes three arguments:

1. The first argument is a string specifying the path to the file.
    
2. The second argument is an enumeration of the type `FileMode`, which determines how the operating system should open the file. In this case, `FileMode.OpenOrCreate` means that the file should be opened if it exists; otherwise, a new file should be created.
    
3. The third argument is an enumeration of the type `FileAccess`, which indicates the type of access you want to the file. Here, `FileAccess.ReadWrite` grants the rights to read from and write to the file.
    

#### Reading and Writing with FileStream

To write data to a file, you use the `Write` method of the `FileStream` class.



```csharp
byte[] data = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
fs.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
```

In this example, `Write` is called on the `FileStream` object `fs` to write the byte array `data` to the file. The second and third arguments to `Write` are the starting point in the array and the number of bytes to write, respectively.

To read data from a file, you can use the `Read` method of the `FileStream` class, as shown in the following example:



```csharp
byte[] data = new byte[1024];
int bytesRead = fs.Read(data, 0, data.Length);
```

In this case, `Read` is called on the `FileStream` object `fs` to read bytes into the `data` array. The second and third arguments to `Read` are the starting point in the array and the maximum number of bytes to read, respectively. `Read` returns the actual number of bytes read, which may be less than the requested number if the end of the file is reached.

#### Manipulating the File Position

An important feature of `FileStream` is the ability to get or set the position within the file, represented by the `Position` property. For example, you can move to the start of the file with the following code:



```csharp
fs.Position = 0;
```

Or, you can move to a specific position within the file:



```csharp
fs.Position = 50; // Moves to the 51st byte in the file.
```

This feature of random access is particularly useful when dealing with large files or when you need to jump to specific sections of a file.

#### Closing the FileStream

Finally, when you're done with a `FileStream`, it's essential to close it to free up the resources it's using. You can do this with the `Close` method:



```csharp
fs.Close();
```

Alternatively, since `FileStream` implements `IDisposable`, you can take advantage of the `using` statement to automatically close the stream:



```csharp
using (FileStream fs = new FileStream("test.dat", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.ReadWrite))
{
    // perform file operations...
}
```

When the `using` block is exited (either after normal execution or an exception), the `Dispose` method is called on `fs`, which in turn calls `Close`, ensuring that the file is properly closed.

## StreamReader and StreamWriter

`StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` are powerful classes within the `System.IO` namespace for reading and writing character data. As high-level abstractions, they provide a more convenient interface for dealing with text files than the `FileStream` class.

### StreamReader

A `StreamReader` reads characters from a byte stream in a particular encoding (such as UTF-8). It's ideal for reading text files.

##### **Creating a StreamReader**

A `StreamReader` is typically instantiated with a `FileStream` or a file path. For example:



```csharp
StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("test.txt");
```

This code creates a `StreamReader` to read from the file `test.txt`.

##### Reading Data with StreamReader

`StreamReader` provides several methods to read data from the stream. For instance, you can read one line at a time with `ReadLine`:



```csharp
string line = sr.ReadLine();
```

To read the entire content of the file at once, you can use the `ReadToEnd` method:



```csharp
string content = sr.ReadToEnd();
```

Remember to close the `StreamReader` when you're done with it:



```csharp
sr.Close();
```

### StreamWriter

While `StreamReader` is used for reading text data, `StreamWriter` is used for writing text data. It's an efficient way to write text to a file or a stream.

##### Creating a StreamWriter

A `StreamWriter` can be instantiated in a similar way to `StreamReader`. You can pass a `FileStream` or a file path to the constructor:



```csharp
StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter("test.txt");
```

This code creates a `StreamWriter` that writes to the file "test.txt".

##### Writing Data with StreamWriter

`StreamWriter` provides several methods for writing data to the stream. You can write a string with the `Write` method:



```csharp
sw.Write("Hello, World!");
```

To write a string and then immediately follow it with a newline, use `WriteLine`:



```csharp
sw.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

Remember to close the `StreamWriter` when you're done with it:



```csharp
sw.Close();
```

In StreamReader and StreamWriter, you can use the `using` statement, which automatically closes the stream when the `using` block is exited. This ensures that resources are correctly disposed of, even if an exception is thrown within the block:



```csharp
using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter("test.txt"))
{
    sw.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
}
```

## File and Directory

The `File` and `Directory` classes in the `System.IO` namespace contain static methods for creating, copying, deleting, moving, and opening files and directories and performing various other file and directory operations.

### File

The `File` class allows you to work with files. It provides static methods, so you don't need to instantiate the class to use these methods.

##### Creating and Writing to a File

The `WriteAllText` method writes a specified string to a file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, the method will create it:



```csharp
File.WriteAllText("test.txt", "Hello, World!");
```

##### Reading from a File

The `ReadAllText` method reads all text from a file and returns it as a string:



```csharp
string content = File.ReadAllText("test.txt");
Console.WriteLine(content);
```

##### Checking if a File Exists

You can check whether a file exists using the `Exists` method:



```csharp
if (File.Exists("test.txt"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("The file exists.");
}
```

### Directory

The `Directory` class provides static methods for manipulating directories.

##### Creating a Directory

You can create a directory using the `CreateDirectory` method:



```csharp
Directory.CreateDirectory("TestDirectory");
```

This code creates a new directory named `TestDirectory`. If the directory already exists, this method does not create a new directory but doesn’t return an error.

##### Checking if a Directory Exists

You can check whether a directory exists using the `Exists` method:



```csharp
if (Directory.Exists("TestDirectory"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("The directory exists.");
}
```

##### Getting Files and Subdirectories

The `GetFiles` method returns the names of files in a directory, and the `GetDirectories` method returns the names of subdirectories:



```csharp
string[] files = Directory.GetFiles("TestDirectory");
string[] subdirectories = Directory.GetDirectories("TestDirectory");
```
# 3. Network I/O

---

Network Input/Output (I/O) forms the backbone of most modern applications. It's how applications interact with networks, allowing them to send and receive data to and from remote servers.

C# provides comprehensive support for `Network I/O` operations through its `System.Net` and `System.Net.Sockets` namespaces, among others. These namespaces include a variety of classes and methods that encapsulate the complexity of network programming, making it easier for developers to create network-centric applications.

## HttpClient

The `HttpClient` class in C# is a part of the `System.Net.Http` namespace and provides a modern, flexible, and highly configurable way to send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses from a resource identified by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). It's frequently used to consume APIs, download files, or scrape web content.

The `HttpClient` class is designed to be re-used for multiple requests. As such, it's typically instantiated once and re-used throughout the life of an application, which can improve performance and system resource usage by allowing socket reuse.

The `HttpClient` class includes several methods to send HTTP requests. The primary methods are:

- `GetAsync`: Sends a GET request to the specified URI and returns the response body as a string.
- `PostAsync`: Sends a POST request to the specified URI with a specified content.
- `PutAsync`: Sends a PUT request to the specified URI with a specified content.
- `DeleteAsync`: Sends a DELETE request to the specified URI.



```csharp
HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

// Send a GET request
var response = await client.GetAsync("https://api.example.com/data");

// Ensure we get a successful response
response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

// Read the response content
string content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

```

In this example, we create an instance of `HttpClient`, send a `GET` request to a specified URI, ensure we received a successful response, and then read the response content into a string.

#### GetAsync

`GetAsync` sends a `GET` request to a specified URI. This is an asynchronous operation, meaning the method returns immediately after calling without waiting for the HTTP response. Instead, it returns a Task representing the ongoing operation, which eventually produces the `HttpResponseMessage` once completed.



```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static readonly HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    static async Task Main()
    {
        try
        {
            HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync("http://api.example.com/data");
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
        }
        catch(HttpRequestException e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Exception Caught!");
            Console.WriteLine($"Message: {e.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we send a `GET` request to `http://api.example.com/data`, and then read the response body into a string.

#### PostAsync

`PostAsync` is another method in the `HttpClient` class. It sends a POST request to a specified URI and some HTTP content. Like `GetAsync`, it's an asynchronous operation and returns a `Task<HttpResponseMessage>`.



```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static readonly HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    static async Task Main()
    {
        try
        {
            var json = "{\"name\":\"John Doe\"}";
            HttpContent content = new StringContent(json, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
            HttpResponseMessage response = await client.PostAsync("http://api.example.com/data", content);
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
        }
        catch(HttpRequestException e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Exception Caught!");
            Console.WriteLine($"Message: {e.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, we send a JSON object as the body of our POST request.

#### PutAsync

`PutAsync` works much like `PostAsync`, but it sends a `PUT` request instead. It's used when you want to update a resource at a specific URI with some new data.



```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static readonly HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    static async Task Main()
    {
        try
        {
            var json = "{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"John Doe Updated\"}";
            HttpContent content = new StringContent(json, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
            HttpResponseMessage response = await client.PutAsync("http://api.example.com/data/1", content);
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
        }
        catch(HttpRequestException e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Exception Caught!");
            Console.WriteLine($"Message: {e.Message}");
        }
    }
}

```

In this example, we send a PUT request to update the resource at `http://api.example.com/data/1` with new data.

#### DeleteAsync

Finally, `DeleteAsync` sends a `DELETE` request to a specified URI. It's typically used when deleting a resource at a specific URI.



```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static readonly HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    static async Task Main()
    {
        try
        {
            HttpResponseMessage response = await client.DeleteAsync("http://api.example.com/data/1");
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
        }
        catch(HttpRequestException e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Exception Caught!");
            Console.WriteLine($"Message: {e.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, we send a `DELETE` request to `http://api.example.com/data/1` to delete the resource.
